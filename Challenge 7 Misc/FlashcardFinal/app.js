// Lessons Learnt:
  // Static v Dynamic
    // Static files like images and style sheets don't need to be processed by the application. They just need to be delivered to the browser.

  // for sequencing and understanding Express' execution flow see: https://teamtreehouse.com/library/the-next-function-and-a-closer-look-at-middleware

  // Developers will often have a local database (a local file of data) for testing before building the main database later.
    // This is known as a flat data file.

  // ERROR HANDLING IN EXPRESS
  // In Express, you can use the next function to signal an error in your app.
  		//By passing an object as a parameter to next, Express knows there is an error to handle. Express will then immediately terminate and handle the error.
  // http codes aren't a native part of JavaScript's error object.

  //A 404 signals that the user requested the route that is exist.
  		//Remember, when an app gets a request, it will go from one app.use call to the next looking for a match. If it gets to the end without finding a route and there are no errors, Express' native handler will send a 404 back to the client with some plain text. If we catch the request before it gets to the end of the line, we can send users a better page.

  // read the data from the stored cookie.
    // now with the cookie, if the browser is refreshed the name is still displayed and data not lost.
      // NOTE NEVER STORE SENSITIVE DATA IN COOKIES!! They're in plain text and could be seen by anyone.

  // The express server needs to be restarted to apply any new routes or changes made in development.
    // We can do this from the command line by hitting Ctrl+C to stop the server.
    // Since the server is stopped, we'll need to start it back up the same way we did the first time.


  // app.get('/hello', (req, res) => {
  //   res.send('<h1>Hello, Javascript Developer!</h1>'); // the send method sends a string to the client
  // });


  // APP.USE
  // You'll often pass middleware as an anonymous function into the app.use method
  // Earlier middleware run before later ones. They are sequential as they appear in the code.
    //this is even the case when more than one function passed to app.use, as in the case of 'one' and 'one and a half' below
      // app.use((req, res, next) => {
      //   console.log('One');
      //   next();
      // },
      // (req, res, next) => {
      //   console.log('One and a half');
      //   next();
      // });
      //
      // app.use((req, res, next) => {
      //   console.log('Two');
      //   next();
      // });


  // CLOSURES
  // // An outer function that returns an inner function is known as a closure.
  // function middleware() {
  //   return function(req, res, next) { // this function is known as a closure!
  //     // middleware logic
  //   };
  // }
