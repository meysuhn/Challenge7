The Task

In this project, you'll use Twitter’s REST API to access your Twitter profile information and render it to a user. The page should automatically authenticate access to your Twitter profile. It should use this access to populate three columns on your page:
 - Your 5 most recent tweets.
 - Your 5 most recent friends.
 - Your 5 most recent private messages.

 With the provided HTML and CSS starter files, you'll be able to see what the final result should look like. Replace the example data from the HTML file with your own information, which you'll grab directly from Twitter's API.

Chris' NOTE:
Use an html to Jade converter.

I think a different route will be needed for each of the example html sections? the last vid of the Express course good for this.

(1) Understand the HTML.
  // See which bits need their own pug file
  // Which bits become part of the main layout
Re-watch the videos to help with this process.


Sections required (i.e. a pug layout for...)
A header
A footer
Create a pug for any common code that you see.
  // pug templates can be chained together. So one can extend to another that extends to another.

Notes for Later:

// Need to add a website url later on twitter app page.
  // (If you don't have a URL yet, just put a placeholder here but remember to change it later.)

// I think to complete the extra credit tasks I'll need to do this later:
 // I would ignore the Callback URL field. If you are allowing users to log into your app to authenticate themselves, you’d enter the URL where they would be returned after they’ve given permission to Twitter to use your app.
 // FYI petmissions set to 'Read, Write and Access direct messages'
