I think a different route will be needed for each of the example html sections?
  the last vid of the Express course good for this.

Tue 25th:
Rewatch vids to figure out how to get all three routes at same time.
  // And also on how to capture user input.



Sections required (i.e. a pug layout for...)
A header
A footer
Create a pug for any common code that you see.
  // pug templates can be chained together. So one can extend to another that extends to another.

Notes for Later:

// Need to add a website url later on twitter app page.
  // (If you don't have a URL yet, just put a placeholder here but remember to change it later.)

// I think to complete the extra credit tasks I'll need to do this later:
 // I would ignore the Callback URL field. If you are allowing users to log into your app to authenticate themselves, you’d enter the URL where they would be returned after they’ve given permission to Twitter to use your app.
 // FYI petmissions set to 'Read, Write and Access direct messages'
