// This code will create a server, and when I run it, the server will run on my machine.

// const express = require('express'); // Element 1/3 of a basic Express App

// const app = express(); // Element 2/3 of a basic Express App
    // the express function returns an express application
    // the app variable is now the central part of our application

// app.listen(3000, () => { // Element 3/3 of a basic Express App
    // console.log('The application is running on localhost:3000!');
// }); // this sets up the local development server on port 3000
  // the listen method can take an optional callback parameter, which is what we've done here.
